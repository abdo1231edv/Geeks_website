      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        In this 21st century, the term “technology” is an important issue in
        many fields including education. This is because technology has become
        the knowledge transfer highway in most countries. Technology integration
        nowadays has gone through innovations and transformed our societies that
        has totally changed the way people think, work and live. As part of
        this, schools and other educational institutions which are supposed to
        prepare students to live in “a knowledge society” need to consider ICT
        integration in their curriculum It has been proven that the use of ICT
        in the classroom increases the motivation of the students, showing more
        interest and becoming more involved in the areas they study. ICT enables
        the use of innovative educational resources and the renewal of learning
        methods, establishing a more active collaboration of students and the
        simultaneous acquisition of technological knowledge. the use of
        resources as varied as videos, websites, graphics, and games make
        traditional subjects more interesting. Multimedia content is a very
        useful tool to bring different subjects closer to students in a complete
        and ententertaining way

        <h1>Problem in education</h1>
        <p>
          Our country suffers from a serious problem is (education)
          The main causes that have led to deterioration of the educational process in Egypt  is that the low quality of education the due to many things like the bad ways of teaching  like using traditional and boring ways ,the over crowdedness of the class rooms ,unqualified teachers , teacher shortage ,……ect<br>
          traditional and boring ways:
          traditional learning is really boring way In a traditional classroom setting, students are made to sit passively while the teacher delivers a lecture. There are reasons as to why many teachers seem dissatisfied with this practice. 
          
          a. Students' focus is set in the wrong direction; in taking notes rather than understanding and absorbing new concepts.
          
          Result:
          <ul>
          <li> students' inability to grasp key ideas and concepts,</li> 
          <li>Failed lesson objective.</li>
          
          Too much focus on presentation, little time left for practice: Since a teacher has to deliver a fixed number of concepts within a limited time, most classroom activities are sufficed to the presentation stage only. Practice is left for the student to do as homework.<br>
          Material obstacles: Which means those obstacles that are related to tools and materials and not to people, lack of resources, lack of time, poor absorption by the institutes of modern technology methods or the problems of internet and computer networks.

        <h1> How to make education fun</h1>
        <p> E-Learning has many benefits and holds great promise for the future of education. But what are the other positives of eLearning that set it apart from other learning methods<br>
          Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that combines the real world and computer-generated content Many students are already benefiting from notebooks that utilise special markers which react to being placed in front of a computer screen or a mobile device offering 3D images.<br>
          Both of e learning and augmented reality will make education much more better now we will know E learning and Augmented reality in more details</p>
     
          <div class="ab" id="E-learing">
            <h1>E-Learning</h1>
            <p>E learning:
                A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of electronic resources is known as E-learning. While teaching can be based in or out of the classrooms, the use of computers and the Internet forms the major component of E-learning. E-learning can also be termed as a network enabled transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients at the same or different times. Earlier, it was not accepted wholeheartedly as it was assumed that this system lacked the human element required in learning.
                Benefits of E learning :
                .Online learning could solve teacher scarcity
                In 2019, the EPI (Economic Policy Institute) educational economists wrote in their report that the shortage of experienced teachers is “real, large, growing, and worse than we thought”. Moreover, the LPI (Learning Policy Institute) has also identified the problem of teacher scarcity on numerous occasions
                Flexibility
                The first advantage of e-learning is flexibility in terms of time and place. Learning content is usually made available in short modules and can be paused at any time. Whether you log on while commuting, at work or during your free time- the learning material can be easily made part of your daily routine. Even if you miss a live online workshop, written summaries or a video of the session is usually available to be downloaded. E-learning is therefore ideal for people working or in education, or simply people who want to know more about their favourite hobbies or interests
                Reduced Costs
                
                One of the most obvious benefits of eLearning is a reduction in costs when compared to traditional training methods. In-person training is expensive: add up paying for an instructor, travel time, time off work, and even the cost of physical training materials like workbooks, and it’s easy to see how eLearning is more cost-effective. 
                
                With eLearning, there’s no cost to reproduce mate ,There are also learning platforms such as the ELA platform <em><strong><a href="https://ela-eg.com/">Click Here </a>

                <div class="cd " id="Augmented reality">
                  <h1> Augmented Reality</h1>
                  <P>
                    Augmented reality superimposes sounds, videos, and graphics onto an existing environment. It uses four main components to superimpose images on current environments: cameras and sensors, processing, projection, and reflection..<br>
                      We can use augmented reality in education ...AR is increasingly being adopted in educational settings, often to help students with complicated subjects. For example, students struggling with geometry can use AR to see and manipulate 3D geometric forms... In biology, they can see the human body from the inside and enjoy it very much..Thus, difficult subjects such as biology, physics, and geometry were transformed into fun and easy-to-learn subjects... And Ar can help them in coding..Teachers can also use platforms to develop coding lesson plans with AR technology. For example, Tynker provides teachers with tools to teach coding for video games. It also allows students to build AR classroom projects......<br>
      
                    Advantages of using augmented reality. 
                    <ul>
                   <li> In Collaboration, augmented reality helps us to collaborate in a healthy environment</li>
                   <li> In memory , Augmented reality helps students easily remember things</li>
                    <li>In Sensory development , AR technology can help teachers create lesson plans with multisensory experiences. Students benefit from immersive virtual content</li>
                    <li> Cost effectiveness, The cost of AR equipment is often cited as a barrier to adoption. However, as smartphone use continues to rise among young Americans</li>
                    </ul>
                    Smartphone are already equipped with the hardware needed to run AR apps<br>
                        Augmented reality apps for education <br>
                        <ul>
                       <li>Human Anatomy atlas 2021 </li>
                       <li> Holo human</li>
                       <li> Exoplanet</li>
                       <li> GeoGebra Augmented reality</li>

                      <h1> An example of countries that started to improve the education system</h1>
                      <p>So what really egypt did for make education better,attractive and fun by using E learning and augmented reality <br>
                        In light of the results of the meeting held by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, President of the Republic, in this regard.<br>
                        Dr. Mostafa Madbouly said: During the past years, the state has worked on developing new mechanisms to bring about a radical development of education in Egypt through a modern system. In an effort to keep abreast of all the developments that the world is witnessing, adding that the state has confidence in the success of this system in bringing about the required development, and its confidence increases year after year in the system and the methodology used, as parents receive it positively, indicating that the state has taken two parallel paths in this regard<br>
                        For his part, Dr. Amr Talaat, Minister of Communications and Information Technology, explained that he presented today to the President of the Republic the details of the network established to connect more than 2,500 schools, which relies entirely on fiber optic cables, describing it as the latest and safest means of connection, as no This network depends in any way on the regular Internet, and therefore the entire digital network is a closed network dedicated to educational purposes between schools and the Ministry of Education and Technical Education.
